Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Map:120 - The command line option -c can not be used when running in
   timing mode.  The option will be ignored.
WARNING:LIT:243 - Logical network clki2 has no load.
WARNING:LIT:374 - The above warning message base_net_load_rule is repeated 87
   more times for the following (max. 5 shown):
   clki3,
   osc2_pin,
   r1out,
   clkin0,
   clkin1
   To see the details of these warning messages, please use the -detail switch.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal vinit connected to top level port vinit has been
   removed.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:535 - The following Virtex BUFG(s) is/are being retargetted to
   Virtex2 BUFGMUX(s) with input tied to I0 and Select pin tied to constant 0:
   BUFG symbol "OSC3_BUFG" (output signal=OSC3),
   BUFG symbol "iGCLK_bGCK" (output signal=xFCLK_G),
   BUFG symbol "iSCLK_iSCLK" (output signal=SCLK)
INFO:MapLib:534 - The following XORCY(s) is/are demoted to LUTs because there is
   no MUXCY associated with them. Therefore, we cannot recognize the standard
   carry chain structure:
   XORCY symbol "iUSER_AP_myDDCi/BU19401" (output
   signal=iUSER_AP_myDDCi/N148969),
   XORCY symbol "iUSER_AP_myDDCi/BU25391" (output
   signal=iUSER_AP_myDDCi/N176843)
INFO:Pack:1716 - Initializing temperature to 85.000 Celcius. (default - Range:
   0.000 to 85.000 Celcius)
INFO:Pack:1721 - Initializing voltage to 1.500 Volts. (derated - Range: 1.425 to
   1.575 Volts)
INFO:Pack:1650 - Map created a placed design.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 165 block(s) removed
 120 block(s) optimized away
 193 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).
