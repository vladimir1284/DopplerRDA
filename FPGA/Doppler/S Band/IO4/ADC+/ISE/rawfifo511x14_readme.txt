rawfifo511x14.ngc:
   Binary Xilinx implementation netlist file containing the information
   required to implement the module in a Xilinx (R) FPGA.

rawfifo511x14.v:
   Verilog wrapper file provided to support functional simulation.
   This file contains simulation model customization data that is
   passed to a parameterized simulation model for the core.

rawfifo511x14.veo:
   VEO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a Verilog design.

rawfifo511x14.vhd:
   VHDL wrapper file provided to support functional simulation. This
   file contains simulation model customization data that is passed to
   a parameterized simulation model for the core.

rawfifo511x14.vho:
   VHO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a VHDL design.

rawfifo511x14.xco:
   CORE Generator input file containing the parameters used to
   regenerate a core.

rawfifo511x14_flist.txt:
   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.

rawfifo511x14_readme.txt:
   Text file indicating the files generated and how they are used.

rawfifo511x14_xmdf.tcl:
   ISE Project Navigator interface file. ISE uses this file to determine
   how the files output by CORE Generator for the core can be integrated
   into your ISE project.
