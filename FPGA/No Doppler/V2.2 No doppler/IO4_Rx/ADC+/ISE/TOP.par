   "TOP" is an NCD, version 3.2, device xc2v1000, package fg456, speed -4
This design is using the default stepping level (major silicon revision) for this device (0). Unless your design is
targeted at devices of this stepping level, it is recommended that you explicitly specify the stepping level of the
parts you will be using. This will allow the tools to take advantage of any available performance and functional
enhancements for this device. The latest stepping level for this device is '1'. Additional information on "stepping
level" is available at support.xilinx.com.

* Net Skew is the difference between the minimum and maximum routing
only delays for the net. Note this is different from Clock Skew which
is reported in TRCE timing report. Clock Skew is the difference between
the minimum and maximum path delays which includes logic delays.

Timing Score: 2262

WARNING:Par:62 - Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some suggestions to assist you to meet timing in
   your design.

      Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select "Post-Place &
      Route Static Timing Report").  Go to the failing constraint(s) and select
      the "Timing Improvement Wizard" link for suggestions to correct each problem.

   Increase the PAR Effort Level setting to "high"

   Rerun Map with "-timing" (ISE process "Perform Timing -Driven
   Packing and Placement"

   Run Multi-Pass Place and Route in PAR using at least 5 "PAR Iterations"
   (ISE process "Multi Pass Place & Route").

   Use the Xilinx "SmartXplorer" script to try special combinations of
   options known to produce very good results.

   Visit the Xilinx technical support web at http://support.xilinx.com and go to
   either "Troubleshoot->Tech Tips->Timing & Constraints" or "
   TechXclusives->Timing Closure" for tips and suggestions for meeting timing
   in your design.

INFO:Timing:2761 - N/A entries in the Constraints list may indicate that the constraint does not cover any paths or that it has no
   requested value.
Number of Timing Constraints that were not applied: 1

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
